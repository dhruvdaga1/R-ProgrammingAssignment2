## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
 m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)

}


## This function computes the inverse of special matrix created by
## makeCacheMatrix function above.If it is already calculated it will
## retrieve the inverse

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
 m <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setInverse(m)
        m

}
